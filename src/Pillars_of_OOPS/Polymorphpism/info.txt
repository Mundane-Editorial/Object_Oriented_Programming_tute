Poly : multiple
morph : forms

i.e, whenever a thing exists in more than one form.

========================================================================================================================

Polymorphism : Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
               Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means
               forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

* There are two types of polymorphism in Java: "compile-time polymorphism" and "runtime polymorphism". We can perform polymorphism
  in java by method overloading and method overriding.

* If we overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.

                    TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA

2 types : 1. Runtime polymorphism   (it is slow : it is not preloaded in the memory)
          2. Compile Time           (it is fast : it is already loaded in the memory during compilation of the program)

Runtime Polymorphism : Method overriding AKA Dynamic binding or late binding.
                       (method with same name but different arguments)
                     > It is called runtime polymorphism because compiler reads the data inside the method only when that
                       particular function is called.



Compile time Polymorphism : Method overloading AKA static binding or early binding.
                            (method with same name and same arguments but have different functionality)
                          > It is called compiler time polymorphism because function name, number of arguments, datatype
                            of arguments  are checked during the compilation of the program.


========================================================================================================================
                            COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM

1. In compile time polymorphism, the call is resolved by the compiler.
2. It is also known as static binding, Early binding and overloading as well.
3. Method overloading is the compiler-time polymorphism where more than one methods share the same name with different
   parameters or signatures and different return type.
4. It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.
5. It provides fast execution because the method that needs to be executed is known early at the compile time.
6. Compile time polymorphism is less flexible as  all things executed is known early at the compile time.
7. Inheritance is not involved.


========================================================================================================================
                            RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM

1. In Run time polymorphism, the call is not resolved by the compiler.
2. It is known as Dynamic binding, late binding and overriding as well.
3. Method overriding is the runtime polymorphism having the same method with same parameters or signature but associated
   with compared, different classes.
4. It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.
5. It provides slow execution as compare to early binding because the method that needs to be executed is knownat the
   runtime.
6. Runtime polymorphism is more flexible as all things execute at run time.
7. Inheritance is involved.
