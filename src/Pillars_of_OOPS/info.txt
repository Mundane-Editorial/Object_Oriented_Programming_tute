4 pillars of OOPs are :
    1. Abstraction
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Inheritence

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Abstraction :
> Abstraction is a technique of providinf only the essential details to the user by hiding the
unnecessary or irrelevant details of an entity.
> Abstraction enables us to provide a simple interface to a user without asking for complex details to perform an action.

Advantage : This helps in reducing the operational complexity at the user-end.


CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING ABSTRACT CLASS AND INTERFACES

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Encapsulation :
Encapsulation is a core principle of object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and methods into a single
unit, typically a class, while controlling access to its internal state. It enhances data security by restricting direct
access to internal variables, improves maintainability by separating implementation from the interface, and promotes
code reusability and flexibility. By exposing only necessary details and hiding complex internal workings,
encapsulation supports abstraction and ensures that objects interact in a controlled and predictable manner.

CAN BE ACCESSED USING ACCESS MODIFIERS : PUBLIC PRIVATE PROTECTED

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Polymorphism :
> It is a feature that allows you to perform an action in multiple or different ways.
> There are two types of polymorphism
    1. Method overloading - Static Polymorphism (static binding)
    2. Method overriding - Dynamic Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)

Advantage : Programmer code can be reused via polymorphism

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Inheritance :
> Inheritence is a technique of acquiring the properties of another class having features in common.
> It is also known as a child parent relationship where a child inherits the properties of its parent.

Advantage : It allows us to increase the reusabilty and reduce the duplication of code.
