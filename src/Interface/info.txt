Interface :
   An interfaces a set of abstract methods you would want your class to implement. These methods are public and abstract
   These methods are public and abstract by default, and any class implementing your interface will need to provide
   implementations of those methods.

   intefaces are used to achieve abstraction and implement multiple inheritance.


>> Can be implemented using Implements.
>> Interface doesn't have objects. ONLY classes can have objects.

                                    >> POITNS TO REMEMBER <<

1. An Interface can be used when we want to achieve 100% abstraction. On the other-hand, abstract classes can be used to.
   achieve anything between 0-100% abstraction.
2. An interface cannot have constructors because we cannot create objects of an interface.
3. If you want a class to achieve multiple inheritance, there is only one way : interfaces.
4. If an interface is made private or if the methods in it are made private or protected, then a compilation error will
   be thrown.

1. Interface can be enforce a contract - that is, Provide a specification that classes must implement certain methods if
   they want to use that interface.
2. Interface are used to achieve multiple inheritance.
3. Interfaces can be used to achieve loose coupling - with interfaces we can ensure that changes in one class do not
   affect other classes.

1. Interfaces expose their member variables since they must be oublic.
2. Since an interface can be thought of as a contract implemented by multiple classes, in certain cases, modifying the
   interface could lead to unpredictable behavior fo the classes implementing them.
