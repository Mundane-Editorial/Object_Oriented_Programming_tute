Constructos are methods having same name as of class that are called automatically when a program is executed.

> There are 3 types of constructors in java
    1. Default constructor
    2. parameterized consructor
    3. copy contructor

1. Default constructor  : A default constructor is a constructor that Java provides automatically if you don't define
any constructors in your class. It doesn’t take any arguments and initializes object fields with default values.

2. Parameterized constructor : A parameterized constructor allows you to pass values to initialize the object’s fields
when creating an instance. This constructor takes parameters and uses them to set the object's properties.

3. Copy Constructor : A copy constructor is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. It takes
another object of the same class as an argument and copies its field values to the new object.
